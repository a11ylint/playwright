This package demonstrates how to use [@a11ylint/playwright](https://github.com/a11ylint/core) with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to automate accessibility testing according to the French RGAA (RÃ©fÃ©rentiel GÃ©nÃ©ral d'AmÃ©lioration de l'AccessibilitÃ©) guidelines.  
For more information on RGAA, visit [https://accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr](https://accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr).

## Why Playwright + a11ylint?

Playwright is a powerful browser automation tool, and combining it with `@a11ylint/playwright` allows you to:
- Run automated accessibility audits on real web pages and user flows.
- Integrate RGAA compliance checks into your CI/CD pipelines.
- Generate detailed accessibility reports (HTML, JSON, CLI).

## How to use it

### 1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install @a11ylint/playwright
```

### 2. Write your Playwright test

```typescript
import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import PlaywrightA11ylint from '@a11ylint/playwright';

test('RGAA audit on example.com', async ({ page }) => {
  const a11ylint = new PlaywrightA11ylint();
  await a11ylint.analyze({
    options: { html: true, json: true, cli: true },
    page,
    urls: [
      { url: 'https://example.com', textToWait: 'Example Domain' }
    ]
  });
});
```

### 3. Run your tests

```sh
npx playwright test
```

### 4. View the reports

- Audit reports (HTML, JSON, CLI) are generated in your project directory (see your test or config for output location).
